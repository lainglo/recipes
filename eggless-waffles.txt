Recipe Cuisine: Continental  |  Recipe Category: Breakfast
Prep Time:10 mins    |  Cook time: 16 mins     |  Makes: 4
Ingredients

Self raising flour* - 1 cup
Baking soda - 1/4 tsp
Brown or white sugar - 1 tsp
Butter, melted- 2 tblsp
Milk - 1 cup
Vanilla essence – 1 tsp (optional)
Lemon – 1/2 tsp

*Self raising flour can be replaced with All purpose flour (Maida) 1 cup + 2 tsp baking powder + 1/4 tsp salt.

 
Method

    Mix flour, sugar, baking soda (all dry ingredients) first with a whisk or you can sieve it twice too. Then add melted butter, milk at room temperature, essence if adding and whisk to a smooth batter. Lastly add lemon juice.
    1-mix
    Heat the waffle maker meanwhile. Grease all the parts of the plate with butter or any spray. Pour a ladle full of batter, just to cover the plate. Do not add more otherwise will overflow in the sides. So while pouring itself, pour everywhere in the plate instead pouring at a same place.
    2-pour
    Close the lid and cook as per the cooking time instructed in your waffle maker manual. Mine takes 3 & 1/2 to 4 minutes. Take out with help of a tong or spatula.
    3-ready 


Notes

        Oil in place of butter also should work fine.
        Lemon helps in reacting with the baking powder and soda and makes it soft, pourous inside and crisp outside.
        Do not add  more baking soda, or powder or lemon juice than mentioned for this recipe, otherwise it may not turn out well.
